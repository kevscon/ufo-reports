Initially, we both assumed that it was possible firework debris but (1) they were not falling (2) continued to burn and (3) started to move after \"hovering\" for >30 seconds.  We ignored the fireworks as we continued to follow these two objects begin to move and then they quickly began to move into the distance.  I wondered if perhaps someone was in a helicopter watching the firework display from above, but the light was \"fire-like\" and flickering -- plus the way they moved was inconsistent with any obvious explanation.  I wonder if anyone was taping the firework display, we did not have our cameras and we are stumped on how to explain what we saw.

      "Two cylindrical golden objects moving slowly far above wind turbines IOWA,On the night of August 6, 2018, around 830 pm, I was driving on a remote highway of northwest Iowa .  I just happened to glance up into the twilight sky ( sun had just set) and was stunned to see a golden cylindrical object slowly flying far up in the sky right between two wind turbines  At first I dismissed it thinking it was an airplane, but it was distinctly different. A golden glow and moving very slowly.  I looked around the sky wondering if it’s a reflection of the setting sun, but it had completely set and there were no other clouds or anything at that level but clear sky.  There were low dark clouds but nothing at that level  Imagine my shock to see a second similar object hovering in the sky to the far left of the sky right.  It was very far away but distinctly the same size as the first one.,It’s interesting that a few minutes prior to my sighting, my internet and gps conked on my iPhone and reappeared almost immediately as I passed the two objects.

      "3 objects spotted separately, shaft of light aimed at one of them.,\tHaving never seen anything like this before, I feel like I may be a bit crazy.  I have been watching a lot of Ancient Aliens and listening to Coast To Coast nightly, but that fact has no bearing on what I actually saw this morning.,\tI am a truck driver, and I drive the same route every night, which takes me from Bloomington, Illinois, up Interstate 39 to Plover, Wisconsin, and back.  This gives an idea of approximately where I may have been in relation to towns or cities, as I wasn’t exactly sure what towns are around the objects I saw.  I do know that the first one was seen in southern Wisconsin, close to the border, probably around the 170-mile-marker or so, before getting on the toll way.,\tAs I have not seen anything like this, it’s difficult to describe, but I will admit that the first and third objects could have easily been airplanes seen from a distance, but I do not think they were.   All three objects were orange in color, all seen from a distance as I was driving, so I couldn’t keep my eyes fully trained on them.,\tThe first one, which was seen around 4:30 A.M. CST, at first did look like it was possibly an airplane coming in for a landing, as it was descending, but when it did a zigzag movement while in descent, I realized I may have seen something not operated by humans.   I know that some military airplanes could pull off a zigzag pattern, but the way it moved while also descending was a bit strange.  I spent 4 years in the Marine Corps, and being an air winger, I frequently witnessed maneuvers by Hornets, EA-6Bs, Harriers, Ospreys, and others.  I never saw any of those things, including helicopters, do anything like what I saw.  Eventually, it got too low and was hidden behind the tree line of the Interstate.  I tried to keep an eye out for it to pop up again, but it didn’t.,\tThe second object was much higher in the night sky, around 5:15 A.M. CST, and was much further away from me than the first was.  I was driving south, and I first saw it almost directly in front of me.  It seemed at first to be moving very slowly east, then sped up a bit.  Up until this point, I didn’t think the first object was enough to file a report, as I stated that it could have easily been an airplane, even with the odd zigzag move, but what happened while watching the second one actually astonished me quite a bit.  After it sped up a bit, I saw a quick shaft of light.  This light was not bright or flashy, and it only lasted a split second, maybe a quarter of a second at the most.  It was like a lightning bolt, but rather than going from the ground to the sky, this bolt came from the sky and was aimed directly at the craft.  Also, it wasn’t jagged like a bolt of lightning, but rather it was straight, like something was beamed from space to the craft.  I have never hear! d or read of anyone seeing anything like this before, so maybe I really am crazy.  Anyway, after this beam to the craft, it kept on moving in an easterly direction and I lost it as it kept going.,The third object was spotted around 5:45 A.M. CST, and this was the least eventful of the three.  I also saw this one coming from the south, or at least that’s where I spotted it since I was driving south.  This one traveled at a leisurely pace for the most part, speeding up one time, but slowing back down soon after.  This one didn’t do anything odd, but also went in an east direction, where I lost it in the twilight of the rising sun.,\tHonestly, of the three things I saw, I really don’t know if any of them was actually extra terrestrial, but they could be.  That’s why I wanted to report them.  I’m truly interested if anyone else saw the shaft of light to the second craft I saw, or if anyone has ever reported such a thing before.\n",

      "Cigar shaped craft with pulsating red & green chevron lights hovering over treeline in Belleville, Indiana.,I had just left Greencastle, Indiana, when I had just entered the Hendricks County line. Approximately 3 minutes away from Belleville, Indiana, I was driving my car on U.S. Highway 40.  I looked up to see a bright star in the right of my windshield, and to the right, I saw a red/green light.  At first glance it looked like a radio tower, so I thought nothing of it.  As I tried to focus in on the object (while also trying to maintain position on the road), I realized that there was no radio tower in that area, nor would a radio tower reach a couple hundred feet above the treeline.  I began to slow down my car so I could focus in on the object more.  Considering I was the only one on the road for a little ways, I slowed down to around 20 mph.  When I looked into my upper left hand side, I saw what seemed to be a blackened cigar shaped craft, with pulsing chevron red & green lights.  It looked like the lights were on a conveyor belt, basically rotating around the cra! ft.  As I began to speed back up, the craft disappeared.  I tried to rule out, though I am not denying the fact that it is a possibility that this craft was in fact a helicopter, plane, or other perfectly normal object.

I was sitting on my living room couch and looked out of the bay window.  Through a large ash tree I saw a very bright orange glowing object that seemed to be getting closer. , I got up and opened my the front door and stepped out onto my front porch.  The object was still being partially blocked by the tree.  By the time I stepped out onto the sidewalk the object emerged from the tree cover and continued moving on a straight path, at a steady speed.  ,I called to my wife and son to come out to see.  The object had moved almost directly over myself and my home. It was emitting what seemed to be an orange glow or fire'  It did not appear to have any other shape as it moved west to east.   ,My son and I observed for about another 30 seconds as it moved father away, As it did it seemed to loose the intensity of it's glow.   A guess at its altitude would be 1,000 to 2,000 feet\n",

      "2 stationary fireballs,I walked outside my house and instantly looked toward the southwestern sky.  Close to  the horizon were 2 stationary lights. They were red-orange in color.  They didn't move at all. The sky was overcast completely.  I couldn't even see the moon or any stars.  We had a severe thunderstorm about 2 hours prior.  The air was still and everything was quiet.  The lights were at a distance, but they were quite noticeable and bright.  After viewing them for about 30 seconds, I turned around to open the front door to yell for my husband.  When I turned back to the southwest, I saw that one of the lights were dimmed and then disappeared.  My husband came outside about 20 seconds later, and I showed him the remaining light.  We stared at it for about 2 minutes, then it dimmed and eventually disappeared., My opinions-The way they seemed to \"burn out\" made me think they were fireballs.  They were not in the normal flight paths for aircraft in this area.  The way they were absolutely still was quite strange.  I wonder if there were more of the fireballs prior to me going outside in the first place.  Tomorrow I will take a photo of how the area looks during the day, and where I remember the fireballs were.\n",

It was by no means a star and was not blinking like an airplane.  The light it emitted was very bright and large.  At first the odd shape was heading Southwest, then it changed directions and started to go West.  The weird thing was though, was that it would stop in the middle of the sky and just suddenly hover there for a few minutes.  We stopped, jumped out of the truck and proceeded to record a quick video of it.  We were shocked as it flashed blue, white and red very quickly in the video.  We hopped back in the truck and started moving again, trying to get closer although it was dozens of miles away in the air.  When we stopped again to gaze at the orb of light, it hovered again over a mountain and begin to suddenly go out like a light switch had been flicked.  It eventually disappeared, but we were all pretty shaken. In many of the pictures the light seems to be a sphere of some sort, moving in small circles while still hovering in the same spot.\n",

I tracked it for about 5 seconds then it was gone, they make no noise so it's very hard to pick up on them you have to only look with your eyes, I believe that is how they go undetected as they are completely quiet and move very fast but graceful through the night sky's.,((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

      "Circular object emitting strong bright light moves unlike any man-made aircraft we know of today.,On Christmas Eve 2012 I noticed circular object emitting a strong bright light. it appeared out of nowhere. It zigzagged moving very fast. It then took off and the size of the object was greatly reduced as well as the strength of the light it emitted. I was hoping someone else was outside at the time, but after it disappeared I noticed no one else was outside. As I approached my home I had saw my neighbors outside I looked up and the object appeared out of nowhere again, traveling at great speeds and it was a very strong light emitting from the object. Luckily, my neighbors were outside and they were waiting for family for Christmas Eve to arrive. My neighbor actually had a camera around his neck, I shouted to him look up look up.,My neighbor was outside with his two young daughters and we were all amazed at how this object traveled and how it disappeared and then reappeared. It had disappeared and reappeared three times in total that night up to about 12 AM.,My neighbor took several pictures of the object. This had no characteristics of a plane or helicopter, it moved at such speeds and such different directions that it could not have been anything we know of right now. It was able to hover, take off, and hover, disappear then reappear. The light it gave off was captivating.,My neighbor and I are waiting for the film to develop. I am very excited to see how this object looks on film. I can assure you, there is no way possible it was a plane or helicopter. Without a doubt it has to be defined as as a UFO.,One more note,the light this object was giving off was so bright that you couldn't really make out the shape of the object. But, when I had seen it appear out of nowhere as it went across the sky I could see somehow, the top of the object. The top was a circular shape, like I could make out the top half of the object. I don't know if because it accelerated out of nowhere that I could make out the top half of the object, but after that the light was too strong to see the physical shape of the object. The light that was a emitting from it was a circular shape, like a fire ball., Note- the film still has to be developed. If my neighbor was able to get the image in his shot, of which I am positive he did, it should be amazing proof as I have never seen a thing like it. Please inform me of the best way to send the images. Thanks.\n",

      "Two silent white spheres crossing the early morning sky.,I was at Lindsey Gardens by the Salt Lake Cemetery; looking for the last of the meteor shower. I saw a really bright white sphere moving smoothly across the sky.  It seemed to get brighter and brighter like it was approaching or getting closer and I started to get scared, because I did not know what I was seeing.  Then another one not as bright was going in the opposite direction heading right to it and the brighter sphere moved down at a 90 degree angle! And then just kept on going.  The fainter sphere kept going in the other direction and quickly faded away. And then I watched the brighter sphere move across the sky.  It only took about 2 minutes for it to fade completely out of view.  As it faded away it looked just like a star in the sky.  There were no colored or blinking red lights on it. Just a beautiful bright orb looking thing.  I tried to get video of it, but my camera didn't register it.  About 3 minutes later, a plane went over head and I knew the sphere! was definitely not a plane.  The plane made noise and had two bright white lights on each wing and a blinking red light.  I don't know what it was. But I'm going there again with friends to see if it comes back.  It was amazing.  There's a lot going on at Dugway recently....it could be a military experiment. \n",
